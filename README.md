# In-Situ-Optical-Monitoring-and-Defect-Detection-of-Binder-Jetting-Printer-with-Deep-Ranking
An image collecting system is developed to capture optical images of printed pattern in a X1 innovent+ printer. Then, segementation methods are applied to the images and the segmented images are compared with a reference image by deep ranking model.

The image collecting system includes a RaspberryPi 3B computer, a Raspberry Pi HD camera, a pair of beam-break sensors and a desktop computer. It also includes some mounting structures to fix the electronics to the printer.
